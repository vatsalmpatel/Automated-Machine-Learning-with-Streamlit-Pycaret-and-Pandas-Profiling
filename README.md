# Automated ü§ñ Machine Learning with Streamlit, Pandas üêº Profiling and Pycaret

In this project I created a streamlit application to created an automated pipeline to load a dataset from your local machine, profile the dataset with Pandas Profiling, and then create a model with PyCaret to either perform classification or regression based on the type of column specified and then give the ability to download ‚¨á the model and deploy/ use the model whereever you like. 

# How to install all the dependencies ‚ùì 

Create a new anaconda environment using `Python 3.7`:

```Bash
conda create -n new_env_name python=3.7
```

After creating the environment, just activate the created environment:

```Bash
conda activate new_env_name
```

After this, just install all the dependencies fron the requirements file using:

```Bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
